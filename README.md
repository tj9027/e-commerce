# e-commerce
🍳 A simple e-commerce built in React. 😹 I mostly built this with the purpose of practicing hooks, so you won't find any class components here.

 

# How to start!
🚀 Runs the server in the development mode. That's npm start | yarn start, depending on your setup. 
    Then go to the client folder and run npm start | yarn start.

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser, and get cooking!
